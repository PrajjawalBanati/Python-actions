# Python-actions
- The following repository will be performing a unit test on your python file noted with its given test case. Unit testing tool which I have used is `Pytest`. For more information on how to create a unit test case in python follow the given steps.
- Create a `name.py` file
- After that create a test case file which you can either name it as `test_name.py` or `name_test.py`. Remember that including `test_` is important as pytest will be picking up those files which either start or end with keyword `test`.
- Moving on add this action to your .yml file and that's it you are done.
- Your `test_name.py` will be executed and will return the result.
